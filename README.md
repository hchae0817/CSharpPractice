# C# Coding Practice Repository

Welcome to the **C# Coding Practice** repository! This project is dedicated to sharpening your skills in **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **problem-solving** using the C# programming language. It’s ideal for software engineers preparing for coding interviews, students learning computer science, or anyone looking to improve their algorithmic thinking.

## 📌 Key Practice Areas

### 🔹 Substring & Character Problems
- **LongestSubstringDistinctCharacters**: Find longest substring with all distinct characters.
- **LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingChar**:
  - Solution + Unit Test (`LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingChar.Tests`)
  - Implements a sliding window approach to optimize time complexity.

### 🔹 Array & Interval Problems
- **SortedInputArray**: Exercises involving sorted input arrays.
- **SortedArray.Test**: Unit test coverage for sorting logic.
- **MergedInterval**: Merge overlapping intervals from a list of ranges.

### 🔹 Stack & Scheduling
- **StackProblem01**: Classic stack-based problems (e.g., balanced parentheses).
- **TaskSchedular**: Simulates a scheduler to space out identical tasks using idle slots.

### 🔹 Frequency Analysis
- **FrequentElement**: Identifies most frequent or top-K frequent elements.

### 🔹 System Design
- **ParkingLot**: A simplified OOP design exercise modeling a parking lot system.


## ▶️ Running the Code

To run a specific console application or test project, follow these steps:

### 📌 Prerequisites
- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- Visual Studio 2022+ or Visual Studio Code with the C# extension

---

### 🏃‍♂️ Run a Practice Project

Navigate to the folder containing the `.csproj` file and use the `dotnet run` command:

```bash
cd LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingChar
dotnet run
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Run a Unit test 

```bash
cd LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingChar
dotnet run
```

## ✍️ Best Practices
- Follows C# naming conventions (PascalCase for methods/classes)
- Problem areas are split into folders for readability and modularity
- Tests follow [Project].Tests structure for separation of concerns
- Easy extensibility: simply add new folders and files to grow the library
